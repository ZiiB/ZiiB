- 👋 Hi, I’m @ZiiB
- 👀 I’m interested in quite a lot of stuff actually. 3D Printing (both applications for it and machines), robotics, drawing, and coffeemaking
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github properly for ML projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting my code to work, most of the time
